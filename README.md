# Hobbyistic 

Our Senior Design project.

Hobbies provide a fulfilling and productive use of oneâ€™s free time. Some people with struggling starting new hobbies while staying on track. 

We want to create a web application on the computer that would allow users to learn hobbies in a self-paced workflow. Users could input their hobbies, set milestones/goals, and track their time if desired. In addition, users would receive a notification based on their schedule of when to work on their hobby or status updates on their progress in reaching their goals. 

Hobbyistic is a web application that helps provide a fun and efficient way to learn and track your hobbies. This app is for users who struggle with time management or commitment to staying focused on their goal. This app will be driven towards having fun in learning hobbies. The user will be given goal based sections and data to help them visualize their progress. The user can choose how much time they want to give on a daily week to week schedule to help with their progress and choose to be given optional notifications to motivate them in the right direction.
